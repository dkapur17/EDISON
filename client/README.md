# EDISON

A simple voice assitant written in JavaScript, given a visual UI with React. As of now, Edison can:
* Tell the time, at current, or any location
* Tell the current Date
* Crack jokes(clean, dark, programming, also pretty dirty ones)
* Answer questions like "Are you there?" and "Who are you?"

As of now, EDISON is just a front-end application. However, to perform more API calls, a back-end must also be implemented to prevent Cross Origin Resource Sharing. This will potentially be done using Firebase Cloud Functions.

Features that will be added include in the future are, but not limited to:
* Word meaning searches
* Wikipedia searches
* Reminders
* Schedule maintainance (Potentially using Firebase)
